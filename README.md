# Infinite Rotation
Made by Gupo33 for High Seas

# The Game
The concept of infinite rotation is that you do not control the player's movement (this sounds weird, I'll explain in a second).
Instead, you can affect the movement by changing direction (counterclockwise or clockwise) and the speed (speed up or slow down).
But no matter what you do, you will continue to *rotate* around the boss *infinitely*.

# Controls
These may seem weird at first, but they'll make sense in-game!
- W: speed up
- S: slow down
- A: go counterclockwise
- D: go clockwise
- SPACE: shoot
- E: shield (you cannot shoot & shield at the same time, and lasers can go through your shield!)
- Q: pause/unpause

# How to play
