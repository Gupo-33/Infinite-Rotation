Day 2 & 3: help, how do I?
  - added "help" and "credits" sections
  - "you win" and "game over" screens

Day 5: naming is hard

Day 6: a boss walks into a bar

  - polished Automaton bossfight

Day 7: difficulty curve
  - added pausing & unpausing
  - added Vaporizer bossfight (final bossfight for now, the rest will come in the form of updates)
  - insane difficulty curve fr fr

Day 8: the end
  - tears in my eyes rn
