Day 1: setup!
  - created github thingy
  - added player
  - added basic mechanics (shooting, direction & speed changing, etc)
  - started work on tutorial boss

Day 2 & 3: help, how do I?
  - added "help" and "credits" sections
  - "you win" and "game over" screens
  - began adding sfx and music

Day 4: sad excuse for development
  - didn't really do much
  - thought of idea (and kinda started implementing) the first non-tutorial boss
